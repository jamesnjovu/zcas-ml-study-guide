# Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the ML Study Guide application following modern React best practices and clean code principles.

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Data Layer** (`app/data/units.js`): Extracted all unit data from the main component
- **Constants** (`app/constants/index.js`): Centralized all magic strings and configuration values
- **Custom Hooks** (`app/hooks/`):
  - `useNavigation.js`: Handles all view navigation logic
  - `useQuiz.js`: Manages quiz state and operations
- **Components** (`app/components/`): Created reusable UI components
  - `Button.js`: Flexible button component with variants and sizes
  - `Badge.js`: Reusable badge component
  - `Card.js`: Consistent card wrapper
  - `UnitCard.js`: Specialized unit display component
  - `QuizQuestion.js`: Quiz question display logic
- **Views** (`app/views/`): Separated each view into its own file
  - `HomeView.js`
  - `QuizListView.js`
  - `UnitView.js`
  - `QuizView.js`

### 2. **Code Reduction**
- Main component reduced from **499 lines** to **106 lines** (79% reduction)
- Improved readability and maintainability

### 3. **Type Safety**
- Added PropTypes validation to all components
- Ensures type correctness and better developer experience

### 4. **Reusability**
- Created generic, reusable components (Button, Badge, Card)
- Components can be easily reused across different parts of the application
- Variants and size props allow for flexible styling

### 5. **Custom Hooks**
- Extracted state management logic into custom hooks
- `useNavigation`: Handles all routing and view state
- `useQuiz`: Manages quiz answers, scores, and submission
- Benefits: Better testing, reusability, and separation of concerns

### 6. **Better State Management**
- Used `useCallback` in hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized performance with memoization

### 7. **Consistent Patterns**
- All event handlers follow `onAction` naming convention
- Consistent component structure with PropTypes
- Clear separation between presentational and container logic

## File Structure
```
app/
├── components/
│   ├── Badge.js
│   ├── Button.js
│   ├── Card.js
│   ├── QuizQuestion.js
│   └── UnitCard.js
├── constants/
│   └── index.js
├── data/
│   └── units.js
├── hooks/
│   ├── useNavigation.js
│   └── useQuiz.js
├── views/
│   ├── HomeView.js
│   ├── QuizListView.js
│   ├── QuizView.js
│   └── UnitView.js
└── page.js (main component - now clean and simple)
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify specific features
2. **Testability**: Each component and hook can be tested in isolation
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without touching existing code
4. **Readability**: Clear, focused components with single responsibilities
5. **Reusability**: Generic components can be used throughout the app
6. **Type Safety**: PropTypes catch errors during development
7. **Performance**: Optimized with useCallback and proper memoization

## Best Practices Applied

- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Component Composition
- ✅ Custom Hooks for Logic Reuse
- ✅ PropTypes for Type Checking
- ✅ Consistent Naming Conventions
- ✅ Separation of Concerns
- ✅ Constants for Magic Values
- ✅ Modular File Structure
